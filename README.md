## What's this?

A simple program to create a Windows account you will only know about :)

- Create invisible local accounts without `net user` or Windows OS user management applications (e.g. `netapi32::netuseradd`)
- Works on all Windows NT Machines (Windows XP to 11, Windows Server 2003 to 2022)
- Impersonate through [RID Hijacking](https://r4wsec.com/notes/rid_hijacking/index.html) any existing account (enabled or disabled) after a successful authentication 

Create an invisible machine account with administrative privileges, and without invoking that annoying Windows Event Logger to report its creation!
